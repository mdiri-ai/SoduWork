# Run SoduWork from source

[简体中文](getting-started.md) · **English** · [Back to README](../README.md) · [Developer guide](development.en.md)

Command examples use `sh start.sh` on macOS/Linux. On Windows, use `.\start.cmd` in PowerShell or `start.cmd` in Command Prompt with the same arguments. Standalone Python tools use `python3`; use `py` on Windows, or `python` inside an activated virtual environment.

Your first run has four steps: install the prerequisites, extract the source, start, and sign in. This launcher runs the Hub service, browser management UI, and desktop client on your computer with a private SQLite database. No separate server is needed.

## Install, extract and start

1. Install [Python 3.12 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Node.js 22.19 or newer](https://nodejs.org/). On Windows, enable **Add Python to PATH**. Keep the default Node installation options, including npm. Close old terminals after installation.
2. Download the source ZIP and **extract all files** into a normal folder you can write to, such as `C:/SoduWork`. Avoid system application directories; do not run files from inside the ZIP.
3. Open the folder containing `README.md`, `start.py`, and `client`, then use your platform's launcher:

   | Platform | Default entry point |
   | --- | --- |
   | Windows | Double-click `start-desktop.cmd` |
   | macOS | Double-click `start-desktop.command` |
   | Linux desktop | Open a terminal in this folder and run `sh start.sh --desktop` |

4. On first run, choose your own password for **`admin`**, using **12–128 characters**, then confirm it. Typing is hidden: no characters or asterisks appear. Press Enter after typing. A mistake prompts you to try again without closing the window. Later starts keep the existing password.
5. Keep the window open. The launcher installs dependencies, builds the management UI, prepares the database, and opens the client. Initial downloads can take several minutes. Long steps print a status message about every 15 seconds; the printed `startup.log` path contains the details.

You do not need to create a database, install Docker or Git, prepare an `.env` file, or install each project separately. First-time setup needs internet access; later starts reuse completed work.

The launcher installs both Hub and Runner dependencies in its private `venv/`, checks the Runner's Python imports, and gives the desktop that exact interpreter. You do not need a separate `hub-backend/.venv` for this entry point. If Agent management reports an incomplete source Runner environment, quit the source session and rerun the same launcher; keep the data directory intact.

On Windows, desktop startup also prepares and verifies a private PortableGit command runtime in this instance's application copy so Agents can use Bash, Git, and common tools. No separate Git installation or WSL configuration is needed. Later starts preserve the runtime and download cache and check the tools again. If preparation fails, inspect `startup.log`, fix network access, and rerun the same launcher.

## Know when startup is complete

The terminal prints these key lines (use the actual address shown):

```text
SoduWork is ready: http://127.0.0.1:18989
Administrator: admin
```

The browser and desktop client then open:

- The browser starts on an introduction page. Click **Enter admin console** to reach sign-in. You do not need to download another client from this page.
- Sign in to both interfaces with **`admin` and the password you just chose**. This account belongs to your local instance, not an online service. No additional registration is needed.
- If the browser does not open automatically, visit [http://127.0.0.1:18989](http://127.0.0.1:18989). If you change the port, use the new address printed by the launcher.
- The linked desktop client already points to this local service and uses a separate desktop profile. It does not overwrite an installed client's accounts, server address, or history.

Successful startup makes the application available. AI responses still require your own model service.

## Send your first AI message

If you already saved an API key, continue at step 3: add a concrete chat model, then select Pi and that model in the desktop client. Configuration happens in the browser admin console; conversations happen in the desktop client. Both must use the same Hub.

Have your provider's **API base URL, API key, and model ID** ready. These come from your model provider; the local administrator password cannot replace an API key. Real model calls may incur provider charges.

1. Sign in to the browser management UI, open **Capabilities → Model catalog**, and choose **Connect a service**. In the Chinese UI these are **能力配置 → 模型目录 → 接一个服务**.
2. Fill in and save the service details:

   | Field | What to enter |
   | --- | --- |
   | Identifier | Your own identifier, such as `my-provider` |
   | Name | A recognizable display name, such as “My model service” |
   | Protocol | Follow your provider's instructions; choose OpenAI-compatible only if the service supports that interface |
   | API URL | The provider's base URL; OpenAI-compatible services often include `/v1`. Do not enter the full `/chat/completions` endpoint |
   | API key | Your own service key; leave it empty only when the service requires no authentication |

3. On the service card, choose **Add model** (**加模型**), enter the provider's exact model ID, select **Chat model** (**对话模型**), and save. A custom display name is not the model ID.
4. Return to the desktop client, open a new conversation, and select a **ready execution agent** and the new model. If the agent needs installation or sign-in, follow its setup prompt first. You do not need a remote computer or cloud Runner for your first local conversation.
5. Send “Hello, briefly explain what you can help me do.” A real reply confirms that the AI request path works.

If the model is missing, refresh the catalog or reopen the desktop model selector, then check that both interfaces connect to the same service address. For `401/403`, check the model key and access permissions; for `404`, check the API URL, model ID, and protocol. You can explore the management UI before connecting a model service.

### Device-only model services

Local services added in the desktop's **My models** panel are encrypted in that desktop profile. Their endpoints, keys, model references, and local usage are not uploaded to Hub. Select them in a local Pi conversation; cloud execution, handoff, scheduled tasks, and Hub model defaults require a Hub-managed model. Local image/video definitions remain stored but are not offered through the Hub media proxy.

Signing in to the desktop is still required, and existing conversation and task permissions still apply. After sign-in, Hub model administration and model quotas do not control a local Pi model. The desktop connects directly to its provider. Ordinary conversation directory synchronization continues without model configuration, references, or local usage.

Local choices and runtime transcripts use random model references. The mapping to the real model ID, label, endpoint, and credential stays in the encrypted local catalog; runtime files use placeholders. Existing structured local references migrate without changing message text or acknowledged Hub usage. Removing and re-adding a model does not silently reconnect an old conversation to the new model. This does not encrypt conversation text or files you create, and does not remove copies in external backups.

If secure storage cannot be read, the client preserves the saved configuration and asks you to resolve the storage problem. Invalid edits are rejected without replacing the previous configuration. Switching from a local model to a managed model keeps each call's usage separate.

### Conversation history after switching accounts

Recent conversations, local history, and archives show records belonging to the current account and Hub. Switching accounts or services does not delete the originals. Return to the original account and Hub to view history with verified ownership. Expired short-lived credentials still allow offline viewing under the retained, verified local owner; explicit sign-out hides that account's history.

For old Pi conversations with no ownership record, use **Archive → Import old Pi conversation** in the desktop, select a JSONL file from the local native index, and confirm creation of a read-only copy for the current account. The original stays unchanged; tool permissions and execution state are not restored. Supported Pi files must be readable in full, with a maximum of 32 MiB and 10,000 messages. Unsupported message or attachment formats are rejected rather than silently omitted. Existing foreign or conflicting ownership cannot be bypassed through this import.

Some older records identify an account but lack verifiable information about the original Hub. They remain stored but hidden; direct opening or importing explains the ownership restriction. Restoring access requires trusted evidence of the original service; the import action cannot take ownership of these records. Keep a backup of the desktop profile and do not delete or manually rewrite ownership records.

## Start again and stop

- Use the same launcher next time and sign in with the same account. Data and model settings are retained.
- Press **Ctrl+C** in the startup terminal and wait for shutdown. Closing the desktop window may only minimize it to the tray; choose Quit from the tray to exit the application.
- Do not launch a second copy. If an instance is already running, use its existing terminal and page.
- Before updating source, stop the service and back up the entire data directory and any separate desktop profile. Then update the source and run the same launcher. Do not edit the managed application copy inside the data directory.

## Troubleshooting

### Windows launcher does not start

Read the last lines in the window. If Python or Node is missing, install it using the links above and reopen the launcher. Failures normally keep the window open so you can read the error.

If the window still closes immediately, right-click an empty area in the extracted source folder, choose Open in Terminal, and run:

```powershell
.\start-desktop.cmd
```

To check prerequisites without installing anything:

```powershell
.\start.cmd --check --desktop
```

### macOS launcher permissions

Open Terminal, type `cd ` with a trailing space, drag the extracted source folder into the terminal, then press Enter. Run:

```sh
chmod +x start.command start-desktop.command start.sh
sh start.sh --desktop
```

No `sudo` is needed. Linux desktops can also use the final command. On a headless Linux server, use `sh start.sh` without `--desktop`.

### Password typing shows nothing

Hidden input is normal: no characters or asterisks appear. Press Enter when done. Passwords shorter than 12 characters or a mismatched confirmation prompt you to try again. The account is `admin`; there is no shared default password. Do not delete the database to reset a forgotten password.

### Downloads are slow or setup fails

“Still running” means the installation process has not exited; it does not prove a download has succeeded. Read the printed `startup.log`, check network/proxy and npm/Python package download access, then rerun the same launcher. Do not delete the data directory. The initial Electron download also needs internet access.

### Port already in use

Do not stop an unfamiliar process. Use a free port from a terminal in the source directory, for example:

```powershell
# Windows
.\start-desktop.cmd --port 18990
```

```sh
# macOS / Linux
sh start.sh --desktop --port 18990
```

The browser address becomes `http://127.0.0.1:18990`, and the linked desktop client uses that address automatically. If this port is also occupied, choose another free port.

### Browser works but desktop does not

The Electron binary download has a ten-minute limit. If it times out, choose a reachable mirror or configure your proxy, then rerun the same launcher. For example, set the mirror for your shell before starting.

macOS/Linux:

```sh
ELECTRON_MIRROR=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/ sh start.sh --desktop
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:ELECTRON_MIRROR = 'https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/'
.\start.cmd --desktop
```

Windows Command Prompt:

```bat
set ELECTRON_MIRROR=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/
start.cmd --desktop
```

Existing mirror and proxy settings are passed to the installer, which verifies download checksums. Slow connections can set `ELECTRON_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT` to a larger number of seconds. Successfully installed dependencies are reused on the next attempt.

Check `desktop.log` in the same data directory. Resolve Electron download problems and retry. Linux desktop mode requires a graphical session and Electron's native libraries, such as NSS, GTK, and X11/Wayland. The launcher does not disable the sandbox or install operating system packages.

### Linux installation and secure sign-in

Install `.deb` or `.rpm` packages through your distribution's software installer, or use `apt install ./package.deb` / `dnf install ./package.rpm`, so the package manager resolves dependencies. Packages declare D-Bus, libsecret, and alternative GNOME Keyring / KWallet service dependencies. An existing matching service satisfies the dependency without replacing the user's keyring. The `tar.gz` and source modes do not manage system dependencies; launch them from a graphical desktop session with these services configured.

Start the application as the ordinary user logged into that desktop. First access may show the system's keyring creation or unlock dialog; use a protected keyring. Do not choose an empty password or disable the sandbox to bypass startup errors. If the keyring is locked or its service is temporarily unavailable, preserve the existing device credentials, restore the system service, then fully quit and reopen the application. Do not delete `device-auth.json`, remove keyring items, or convert credentials to plaintext.

The source launcher's Linux desktop mode rejects root users (including launches through `sudo`) before creating instance data or installing dependencies. This check also applies to `--check --desktop` and `--prepare-only --desktop`. Run `sh start.sh --desktop` in an ordinary user's graphical session; use `sh start.sh` for a headless server.

Linux installation acceptance first checks that a fresh `.deb` / `.rpm` installation supplies its credential-service dependencies, then uses an isolated real GNOME keyring to check ciphertext after first launch, restart, and upgrade. The current upgrade scenario reuses dependencies from the initial installation and does not certify that upgrading an older environment resolves newly added dependencies. Container acceptance also does not replace interactive GNOME/KDE and Wayland/X11 sign-in and unlock verification.

To use management while resolving desktop setup, double-click `start.cmd` on Windows or `start.command` on macOS, or run `sh start.sh` on Linux. The browser management UI is for configuration; it is not the desktop AI conversation workspace.

### macOS Keychain and desktop identity

If Git reports an unfinished rebase or merge, finish or safely abort that operation before starting. An intermediate checkout can temporarily restore an older launcher, including its former Keychain and Electron branding behavior. Run `git status` and confirm your intended branch is checked out. Stop the previous source session, then rerun `sh start.sh --desktop`; a running client continues using its previous application copy until restarted.

Source desktop startup prepares a separate cached `SoduWork.app` with the product name and icon. It keeps the development profile separate and does not modify the installed client or the downloaded Electron bundle. This local development bundle uses ad-hoc signing; it is not a signed and notarized release installer.

The macOS desktop retains your operating-system home so it can access the default Keychain. Its application data and workspace remain separate from the installed client, and the local Hub still uses an isolated home and database.

If the default macOS Keychain is missing, startup shows a recovery page before opening the normal workspace. Use **Open Keychain Access** to inspect the login/default Keychain, then quit and restart SoduWork after correcting the system settings. If access is denied or cancelled, the login page reports the secure-storage failure and preserves existing credentials. SoduWork does not reset Keychains or fall back to plaintext storage. Only reset a Keychain when advised by [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/kyca2429/mac).

### Page stops working after closing the terminal

The local service has stopped. Run the same launcher again; your data remains available.

## Optional commands

Run these from the source root. The table uses the macOS/Linux wrapper. Windows PowerShell uses `.\start.cmd` with the same arguments, and Command Prompt uses `start.cmd`.

| Need | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Linked desktop startup | `sh start.sh --desktop` |
| Management service only | `sh start.sh` |
| Check prerequisites only | `sh start.sh --check --desktop` |
| Download and build without starting | `sh start.sh --prepare-only --desktop` |
| Do not open a browser automatically | `sh start.sh --desktop --no-browser` |
| Use a dedicated data directory | `sh start.sh --desktop --data-dir "D:/SoduWork-data"` |

Use the same data directory for preparation and startup. Automation may explicitly use `--password-stdin` for the first password; never put passwords in command arguments or scripts. On Windows, set `SODUWORK_NO_PAUSE=1` to return a failing exit code without waiting for a keypress.

For independent source development, see the [developer guide](development.en.md). The Vite proxy defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:9080`; set `SODUWORK_DEV_HUB=http://127.0.0.1:18989` when using this launcher. The default service is accessible only on this computer. For team deployment, see [Docker self-hosting](../ops/self-host/README.md).

## Ports, storage and updates

```sh
sh start.sh --desktop --port 18990 --data-dir "/path/to/private/soduwork-data"
```

Use the same data directory for preparation and startup. It must be outside the source directory and either empty or already initialized by this launcher. The default service listens only on loopback. Use the [self-hosting guide](../ops/self-host/README.md) for team deployment with PostgreSQL, HTTPS, and backups.

| Platform | Default private data directory |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SoduWork\source-service` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/SoduWork/source-service` |
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/soduwork/source-service`, or `~/.local/share/soduwork/source-service` |

The directory contains the database, attachments, service signing key, logs, and reusable dependencies. The desktop profile normally lives in `desktop-profile/` inside this directory. When using the default macOS data directory, the desktop profile lives separately at `~/Library/Application Support/SoduWork Development/source-service-desktop`. Treat the data directory and desktop profile as private. Never commit it or include it in a source archive. The launcher does not inherit the checkout's `.env`, production database settings, or model credentials.

Before updating source, stop the service and back up the entire data directory and any separate desktop profile. Then update the source and run the same launcher again. To roll back, restore the matching source version and data backup together. Do not delete a database to reset a forgotten password.

## Verify the source launcher

```sh
python3 -m unittest tools.dev.test_start_local
python3 tools/dev/verify_local_start.py
```

The second command installs dependencies in a new temporary instance and verifies real HTTP login, persistence, uploads, source downloads, and process shutdown. It does not use a production database or call a paid model. Native macOS/Linux desktop behavior must be checked on those systems; Windows-only validation is not evidence of a complete three-platform release.

On a machine with a graphical desktop, add `--desktop` to also verify native Electron readiness, the isolated local connection, and desktop cleanup after Ctrl+C and a forcibly closed launcher.

On macOS, run `TMPDIR=/private/tmp python3 tools/dev/verify_source_runner.py` with Node.js 22 on `PATH` and a test Python 3.12+ containing `websockets`. It creates a temporary Hub, desktop profile, and real Runner, signs in with a synthetic account, and checks Agent discovery without creating tasks or calling models. Chromium uses a mock Keychain for this fixture; it does not verify native Keychain access.

For desktop connection and sign-in regression checks, run `node e2e/hub-connection.cjs` from `client`. It uses an isolated Electron profile, OS-encrypted storage, and two temporary HTTP fixtures to check offline address editing, sign-in, identity isolation on switching, returning to the original service, and reopening. Screenshots and reports are written to `outputs/hub-connection/`. It does not connect to an existing service or call a model. This check is also included in `npm run test:e2e:local`.
